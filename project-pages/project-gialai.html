          <div class="body-text">
            <p>Chu Se Commune is located in Gia Lai Province, Vietnam. According to data from the People’s Committee of Chu Se Dun Commune, the commune was re-established 
              in December 2025 under Resolution No. 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, 
              issued by the Standing Committee of the 15th National Assembly on June 16, 2025. This re-establishment merged five former administrative units—Chu Se Town, 
              Dun Commune, Ia Blang Commune, Ia Pal Commune, and Ia Glai Commune—previously part of Chu Se District. 
              The commune officially began operations on July 1, 2025, and now covers 124.94 km² with a population of 60,257, including 14,447 ethnic minority residents 
              (approximately 24% of the population). Chu Se Dun Commune consists of 51 hamlets and villages, 
              one of which is classified as facing exceptionally difficult socio-economic conditions.</p>
            <p>The local economy is primarily based on agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, alongside growing industrial, construction, and trade-service sectors. 
              The average per capita income is €179 per month (approximately €2,151 per year). 
              Poor households make up 1.26% of the population, while near-poor households account for 3.87%.</p>
            <p>Despite progress, many ethnic minority children in Chu Se face challenges completing high school. Financial hardship, differing cultural perspectives, 
              and traditional practices that undervalue formal education lead many students to leave school early, 
              assist with household responsibilities, or seek work in larger cities to support their families. Early marriage also persists, despite awareness campaigns.</p>
            <p>Additional barriers include long distances to high schools (mostly concentrated in Chu Se town center), limited transportation, and underdeveloped 
              infrastructure. These factors contribute to a low quality of life and safety risks for disadvantaged children in the commune.</p>
            <p>During field visits, our team assessed the living conditions of children in Chu Se and spoke with them to better understand their aspirations. 
              Many expressed dreams of becoming doctors, teachers, or engineers despite financial challenges. Our goal is to create sustainable impact by empowering 
              the next generation through accessible education, 
              broader life perspectives, and support for families.</p>
            <p>Respecting local culture, we work closely with local partners who understand the community’s needs and context, ensuring our programs have meaningful 
              and lasting impact.</p>

          <div class="body-text">
            We focus on supporting 13 children and their families who are from poor or near-poor households, and reside in Chu Se  commune, Gia Lai province, 
            Vietnam. The number of children supported may increase depending on your  financial support to the project. The selected children, which range 
            from 12 to 15 years old, should be able to understand the importance of education and are keen to finish high school education at least. 
            If any of 13 children drop out of school, we will cease the support for her/him through this program.

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">
            We learned that a majority of the children decided to drop out of school when they reached the age of 15 in order to work and support their families 
            financially. Therefore, our goal is to support those children who are shouldering economic responsibilities along with their families, 
            giving them an opportunity to complete their basic education and acquire additional skills and knowledge to become skillful workers in the future. 
            We hope that this will provide the children with a better future and open up new doors for their personal development.
            <ul>
              <li><b>Long-term goal</b>:
                Raising awareness, changing mindset, creating new life perspective, sustainable change within communities, inspiring more children through success stories from other participants</li>
              <li><b>Short-term goal</b>:
                To provide tangible support to the children, including tuition fees, health insurance, educational materials, and daily goods.</li>

        <div class="subheader-text">Partners</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">
            Our partners for this project include the Youth Union of Chu Se Dun Commune, a governmental organization, and the teachers in charge of student affairs 
            at the schools where the students study. We have met these partners in person and acknowledged their devotion and high commitment to helping children, 
            thus we decided to collaborate with them. FFA understands the importance of working closely with the local community and supporting the community 
            through engaging and understanding principles. Local partners with their network through school teachers are reliable and have rich knowledge to 
            create impact within the community/families.<br><br>

            The main responsibilities of the partners are:
            <ul>
              <li>Keeping track of the children's educational progress.</li>
              <li>Managing the funds and supporting children to buy necessary items according to their needs.</li>
              <li>Advising the team on cases which require additional assistance.</li>

        <div class="subheader-text">Management of Funds</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">
            The funds will be sent to the official account of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union of Chu Se  commune (every three or six months, 
            depending on the amount of funds raised from the community). The money will not be directly given to the children to avoid situations 
            in which their parents use the money for other purposes, not education.<br><br>

            Each child has different circumstances, so the funds will be used for different purposes. For example, some children may need to pay tuition fees, 
            while others may require health insurance, books, or uniforms, etc. (Children from poor and near-poor households are exempt from tuition fees, 
            but other cases are not). Depending on the needs of each child, the in-charge teacher will request permission to withdraw money from 
            the Youth Union’s account to make the necessary purchases.<br><br>

            Upon receiving the items, the children will sign a confirmation paper. We will closely collaborate with the Youth Union and the incharge teacher 
            to receive periodic reports (every three or six months).

          <div class="body-text">
           The support amount is €20 per month per child (equivalent to €240 per year). There are two forms of support:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Long-term support for one child</b>: The team will suggest a child for you, with basic information about the child’s circumstance. 
                You can send contributions monthly, every 3 months, or every 6 months, depending on your capacity.</li>
              <li><b>Support to the general fund (back-up fund), not specifically for a particular child</b>: This money will be used for children 
                who do not have an allocated sponsor or in the case that their long-term sponsors would like to with-draw their roles. 
                This money can also be used for emergency situations for the children (such as illness, accidents, etc.).</li>
